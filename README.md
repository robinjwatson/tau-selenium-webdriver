- Various techniques to find elements such as buttons, links, text, dropdowns, and more within a web application

- WebDriver API calls to interact with those elements such as clicking, entering and reading text, selecting options, handling popups and alerts, uploading files, working with iframes, and more

- Advanced interactions, such as hovering and sending alternative keys like tab, as well as symbols

- How to integrate the WebDriver API with a test assertion library, such as TestNG

- How to organize our test code using the Page Object Model
